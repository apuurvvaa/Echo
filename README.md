# Echo


a modern, full-stack social media platform that lets users engage with friends and followers, share photos and videos and find new content.  React and Redux were used to build the application's front end, resulting in a responsive and quick user interface. Node and Express ran the back end, and a MongoDB database was used to store user and media data.
Users are able to register for an account, upload, and share photographs and videos, follow other users, and browse the explore feed and hashtags to find new material. Additionally, they're able to send private messages, like, and comment on other users' posts.
